# CTF-Writeups

## About

This repo is a collection of CTF writeups that I have completed on various CTFs. Most of the writeups that I have done are large writeups for beginner CTF for the easire challenges in more advanced CTFs. 

### Disclaimer

I want to be fully transparent in that I might not have solved every challenge that I am doing a writeup on during the live CTF. I may have had to ask for help from other competitors, but I still want post how I was, eventually, able to get to the flag. 

### Why am I Doing This

I am creating CTF writup to:

1. Help other that are beginners like me get to the next level
2. Force myself to actually understand what is going on in the various challenges
3. Get better at creating documentation and walking through my thought process
